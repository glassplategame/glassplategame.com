              The Glass Plate Game is basically a conversation in the trappings of a board game. 
              Adrian Wolfe and I, Dunbar Aitkins, designed it following a class I instigated in 1976. 
              Pieces are used to map, against a mosaic, the conversation as players find and discuss 
              connections between ideas represented by various regions of the mosaic. In the sets 
              there are "idea cards" for composing the mosaic, then numbered cubes and colored 
              transparencies for pieces tracking the conversation.

              The object of playing the game is to spark creative and interesting 
              conversation between the players. Nobody wins. The placement of pieces 
              on the cards marks the expression and manipulation of ideas or concepts. 
              As with conversation, the game is generally played without a goal at the 
              start. Players create and label idea-cards as whim directs them, extending 
              lines of thought that catch the groups imagination. The rules of the game 
              are intended to be an agreement rather than a set of statutes; as written 
              they enforce clarity, cooperation and ease of exploration.

              The Glass Plate Game came out of the effort of several people to 
              develop rules for the Glass Bead Game as alluded to in Hermann 
              Hesse's book Magister Ludi. The Glass Plate Game was first 
              constructed as a table top display, glued to a piece of 
              cardboard and placed in a shallow wood box, covered by a 
              glass plate, hence the name. A chess set was used for pieces. 
              Also some of the symbols were photographs without ideas attached.

              The printed cards are sample ideas to spark lines of thought. To start the game players lay down the cards that seem interesting or appropriate for that playing, adding ideas as they think of them. The picture-graphic is for quick recognition after the players are somewhat familiar with the cards. With the ideas thus laid out the players remove those that anyone cannot understand. Players should help each other understand. <br/>
              Writing ideas on cards is openended but no opinions are allowed; no cards may have a question of truth or falseness. Personal statements are to be made only by relating ideas. Still, a theory is not an opinion. Thus the idea "cars as a vile public nuisance" is acceptable whereas "cars are a vile public nuisance" is not. <br/>
              For those who care to, attaching a diagram, picture or photograph can add impact and beauty to an idea. Also unassigned pictures, particularly photographs, can spark ideas again and again. One could use a deck of unassigned photographs, each with a blank card under it, to speed creation of a new set of ideas for each playing. <br/>
              All the pieces are held in common and should be within reach of everybody. Play begins when someone labels a card with the first sequential cube and a colored square.<br/>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  In making a statement, a player must use a card with an appropriate
                  idea on it, relating it to another idea-card, and label
                  the new card with the next sequential cube (number side up)
                  and a colored square of the same color as the one related to.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In asking a question or making a request a player must speak
                  right after the relation in question (in "Challenge")
                  and record the challenge by turning the cube labeling
                  the relation so that the "C" side is up. A Challenge must
                  be done in the move following the relevant relation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An idea-card cannot be related to unless it has been "opened".
                  A card is open if it is labeled and unrelated, or has a
                  sequential cube with the "P" or "O" face up.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To open an unlabeled card a player labels it with the
                  next sequential cube and a square of an unused color.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To open a card that is labeled and related a player
                  turns the sequential cube to the "P" side (Permit).
                </li>
                <li>
                  To open a card that is Challenged a player turns the
                  sequential cube to the "O" (Okay).
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a relation is Challenged for triteness and talk
                  of it goes nowhere a second player may turn the relevant
                  cube to the blank side, unlabeling the idea-card.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If more than three people are playing then no player
                  may make two consecutive moves; no player may Permit a relation
                  if they labeled either of the idea-cards involved, and no player
                  may Okay a card that they labeled. Starred rules describe moves.

              The point of marking every move and numbering the letterd dice  
              is to insure that trains of thought can be dropped and picked 
              up again easily; no one forgets. Ideas in written form improve 
              the clarity of statements players make. The game is intended to  
              be non-competititve but if the player wants to score points, one 
              point could be awarded for each misspelling discovered among  
              the cards. If the game seems to bring only trite relations that 
              provoke no feeling then possibly the third Challenge request is  
              underused (or the players are trite and provoke no feeling).  
              If the game seems too confining then possibly the players are  
              taking the rules too seriously. 
              
              <br/><br/>
            
              Branching is possible. A player makes a statement labeling a 
              card and using a square of an unused color on the new card and  
              on all other cards to be associated. 

              <br/><br/>

              Cards may be labeled any number of times. Cards may be written 
              up anytime and unlabeled cards may be removed anytime.

              <br/><br/>

              Players may also request a relation be made, by the group or 
              another player, specifying at least one of the idea-cards to be 
              related (this is not a Challenge).

              <br/><br/>

              The game ends with the "return" symbol getting labeled without a 
              colored square and opened with "P" or both "C" and "O" by another 
              player.
